# metabolomics-clustering-analysis-pipeline

THis repo contains a notebook with the pipeline for metabolomics data assessment
The pipeline follows the steps:
1) filtering out metabolites with bad signal or marked batch effect
2) reducing the dimensionality and clustering
3) correlating clusters with output data:
   
      3.1)  correlating clusters with output patient's data


      3.2)  correlating clusters with genomics data (manhattan plot generation)
